### Transformers in Speech Processing: A Survey 

by Siddique Latif, Aun Zaidi, Heriberto Cuayahuitl, Fahad Shamshad, Moazzam Shoukat, Junaid Qadir

"The remarkable success of transformers in the field of natural language processing has sparked the interest of the 
speech-processing community, leading to an exploration of their potential for modeling long-range dependencies within 
speech sequences. Recently, transformers have gained prominence across various speech-related domains, including 
automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, speech para-linguistics, speech enhancement, s
poken dialogue systems, and numerous multimodal applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that 
aims to bridge research studies from diverse subfields within speech technology. By consolidating findings from across 
the speech technology landscape, we provide a valuable resource for researchers interested in harnessing the power of 
transformers to advance the field. We identify the challenges encountered by transformers in speech processing while 
also offering insights into potential solutions to address these issues."
