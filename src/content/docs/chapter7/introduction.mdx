# Unit 7. Putting it all together ðŸª¢

Well done on making it to Unit 7 ðŸ¥³ You're just a few steps away from completing the course and acquiring the final few
skills you need to navigate the field of Audio ML. In terms of understanding, you already know everything there is to know!
Together, we've comprehensively covered the main topics that constitute the audio domain and their accompanying theory 
(audio data, audio classification, speech recognition and text-to-speech). What this Unit aims to deliver is a framework 
for **putting it all together**: now that you know how each of these tasks work in isolation, we're going to explore how
you can combine them together to build some real-world applications.

## What you'll learn and what you'll build

In this Unit, we'll cover the following three topics:

* [Speech-to-speech translation](speech-to-speech): translate speech from one language into speech in a different language
* [Creating a voice assistant](voice-assistant): build your own voice assistant that works in a similar way to Alexa or Siri
* [Transcribing meetings](transcribe-meeting): transcribe a meeting and label the transcript with who spoke when
