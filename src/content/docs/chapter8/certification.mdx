# Get your certificate of completion

The certification process is completely free. 
* To get a certificate of completion: you need to pass 3 out of 4 hands-on assignments.
* To get a certificate of excellence: you need to pass 4 out of 4 hands-on assignments.

The requirements for each assignment are listed in the respective units:
* [Unit 4 Hands-on](../chapter4/hands_on)
* [Unit 5 Hands-on](../chapter5/hands_on)
* [Unit 6 Hands-on](../chapter6/hands_on)
* [Unit 7 Hands-on](../chapter7/hands_on)

For the assignments that require to train a model, make sure to push your model that meets the requirements to Hub with relevant `kwargs`.
For the demo assignment in Unit 7, make sure that your demo is `public`.

For self-evaluation and to see what units you passed/not passed, you can use the following space:  
[Check My Progress - Audio Course](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MariaK/Check-my-progress-Audio-Course)

Once you qualify for a certificate, go to the [Audio Course Certification](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MariaK/Audio-Course-Certification) space.
This space implements additional checks to ensure your submissions meet the assessment criteria.

Type your Hugging Face username, your first name, last name in the text fields and click on the "Check if I pass and get the certificate" button.

If you passed 3 out of 4 hands-on assignments, you will receive the certificate of completion.
If you passed 4 out of 4 hands-on assignments, you will receive the certificate of excellence.

You can download your certificate in pdf format and png format. Don't hesitate to share your certificate on Twitter 
(tag me @mariakhalusova and @huggingface) and on LinkedIn.

If you do not meet the certification criteria, don't be discouraged! Go back to the 
[Check My Progress - Audio Course](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MariaK/Check-my-progress-Audio-Course) space to see which 
units you need to do again to get your certificate. If you are experiencing any issue with either of the spaces,
let us know!
